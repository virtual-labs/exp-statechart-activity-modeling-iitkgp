### About the Experiment 
Capturing the dynamic view of a system is very important for a developer to develop the logic for a system. State chart diagrams and activity diagrams are two popular UML diagram to visualize the dynamic behavior of an information system.

In this experiment, we will learn about the different components of activity diagram and state chart diagram and how these can be used to represent the dynamic nature of an information system.
