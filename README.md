### About the Experiment 
Classes are the structural units in object oriented system design approach, so it is essential to know all the relationships that exist between the classes, in a system. All objects in a system are also interacting to each other by means of passing messages from one object to another. Sequence diagram shows these interactions with time ordering of the messages.

In this Experiment, we will learn about the representation of class diagram and sequence diagram. We also learn about different relationships that exist among the classes, in a system.

From the experiment of sequence diagram, we will learn about different types of messages passing in between the objects and time ordering of those messages, in a system.
